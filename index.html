            The team at Eitan are extremely professional, kind, accommodating and hardworking. They take the time to listen to the client's needs and make excellent recommendations. They are detail-oriented and on time. We had them custom fit closets in our bedroom two years ago and recently had them come back for a laundry room in Reno. Nothing changes great same service and great prices! All of their materials are of high quality and resist wear and tear!           </p>

           <p>
            I found them on Kijiji and was impressed with their professionalism, hard work, honesty and cost-effectiveness. They designed and installed a beautiful product. The workers were excellent and skilled and the manager was very communicative. There was a small dent in the wall during installation and they offered to pay for it right away.           </p>

           <h3> LA Closets ARE Fantastic         </h3>
           <p>
            LA Closets was a great team to work with. They were very responsive and professional. The project was to transform an old wire metal closet in the main bedroom with
             sliding doors into an entirely functional wood storage unit. They worked through the entire design process and material selection process to 
             create a unit that would meet the needs of this family for years to come. I highly recommend them and will reach out to them again if I ever need another closet.
